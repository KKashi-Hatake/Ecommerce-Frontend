# Overview

This is the frontend of an Ecommerce web app a SPA made on MERN Stack. For this I've used **Typescript** throughout the project for better code quality. I've done caching in front end with the help of **Redux Toolkit Query**. For handling tables I've used **react-table** library, for showing errors on frontend I've used **react-hot-toast** library. I've integrated **Stripe** for handling payments and used **Firebase** for google authentication. I've used **SASS** for styling instead of any other UI component library.
